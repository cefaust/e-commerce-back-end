# e-commerce-back-end

### Description 
With this project I was tasked with creating an ecommerce back end that uses express and sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

### Things I included in this project
1. When the use adds their database name, username, and MySQL password to an environmental variable file.  They will be able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
2. When the user enters schema and seed commands. The development database is created and seeded with test data.
3. When the user enters the command to invoke the application, then the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
4. When the user opens API get routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in the formatted JSON.
5. When the user test API Post, PUT, and Delete routes in Insomnia, then they are successfully able to create, update, and delete data in the database.
